# Volatility Generation using Conditional GANs (cGAN) and Quantum GANs (qGAN)
This project explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)‚Äîboth classical and quantum‚Äîto model and generate market volatility based on real-world option chain data.

We are using Conditional GANs (cGANs) to learn a mapping between key financial features (such as strike price, open interest, premium values, and days to expiry) and the corresponding market volatility. The generator learns to simulate realistic volatility values conditioned on these features, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated values to improve training quality.

To further investigate the potential of Quantum Machine Learning in financial data modeling, we are planning to implement a Quantum GAN (qGAN) using IBM Qiskit. This allows us to evaluate and compare the performance of classical vs quantum models in terms of distribution matching, training stability, and sample efficiency on small, structured datasets.
